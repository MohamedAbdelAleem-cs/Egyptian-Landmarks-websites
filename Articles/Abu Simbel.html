                Ramesses II left his legacy, Abu Simbel, on the banks of the Nile River more than 1,200 years BC. Abu Simbel consists of two temples, Great and Small, that are carved into a cliff.  
                <br><br>
                Many historians believe Abu Simbel was built to celebrate Ramessesâ€™ 1274 BC victory over the Hittites. Others think it was built after his 1244 BC victory over the Nubians.    
                <br><br>
                Scholars agree it took 20 years to build. The Great Temple is dedicated to Ramesses II and various gods while the Small Temple is dedicated to his favorite wife, Nefertari. Abu Simbel was named in 1813 for the youngster who took an explorer there.
