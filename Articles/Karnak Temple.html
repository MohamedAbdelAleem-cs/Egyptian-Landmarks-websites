                    The name Karnak Temple may be a misnomer since it’s really a city of temples within one complex. Construction started around 2000 BC and eventually resulted in the largest religious building ever built. The detail the ancient Egyptians created in this complex is simply amazing.

                    The main hall, Hypostyle, features 134 carved columns, and is the largest single religious room in the world. Dedicated to several Egyptian gods, the complex has several smaller temples and a sacred lake that was surrounded by the priests’ living quarters and an aviary.

                    Karnak Temple was a pilgrimage destination for 2,000 years. The temple is in ruins now, but its former greatness still shines through.
