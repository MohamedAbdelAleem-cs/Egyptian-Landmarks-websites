                If you like ancient things, youâ€™ll find them at 3,400-year-old Colossi of Memnon across the Nile River from Luxor. When it was built by Amenhotep III, it was the most opulent and largest temple complex in Erupt, surpassing even Karnak Temple.

                Designed as a memorial to Amenhotep, it was named after Ethiopian King Memnon, a Trojan War hero. The Colossi of Memnon consists of two large statues of Amenhotep looking at the Nile and the sun.

                Smaller statues in front of his throne represent his wife and mother. All statues are made from quartzite sandstone. The Colossi of Memnon are in ruins today, but are still impressive landmarks.
