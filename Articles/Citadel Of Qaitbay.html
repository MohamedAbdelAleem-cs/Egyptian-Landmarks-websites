                Qaitbay citadel has an interesting history that links it to the unique Lighthouse of Alexandria. So letâ€™s take some time to speak about this mesmerizing lighthouse. The Lighthouse was considered to be one of the seven wonders of the world and it kept having its function until the Arab Conquest in addition to other natural disasters, which changed the shape of the lighthouse.

                An earthquake occurred in the 11th century and its octagonal part was damaged. They built a mosque on the top of the lighthouse but another earthquake happened that destroyed the whole building.

                The Circassian Mameluke Sultan Al-Ashraf Qaitbay was one of the most prominent mameluk sultans ruling for about 29 years. He decided to build the citadel to defend the place against the Turks, who were threatening Egypt at that time. He built his great fortress and placed a mosque inside and the citadel continued to function during the Mameluke and the Ottoman periods but it was kept out of the spotlight in 1882 after the British Bombardment of Alexandria city.
